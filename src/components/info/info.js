                    <p id="about-paragraph-1">The Digital City Series is a photographic project of digitally constructed city portraits from around the world. These portraits are created by splicing together diverse scenes from each city to form a singular square composition. The images are composed in a seamless fashion that invite the viewer to enter the picture and experience different parts of the city as one.</p>
                    <p id="about-paragraph-2">"In Cubist artworks, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted formâ€”instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context."<span id="about-reference-number">1</span></p>
                    <p id="about-paragraph-3">In the modern world, it is now possible to manipulate the photographic image with greater detail and accuracy. This series analyzes our environments in a greater context, by breaking up and reassembling the city into a realistic view, using digital technology to make context smoother.</p>
